"12 ContributorsRemember Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIn the darkest hour when I cannot breathe\nFear is on my chest, the weight of the world on me\nEverything is crashing down, everything I had known\nWhen I wonder if I'm all alone\n\n[Chorus]\nI remember, I remember\nYou have always been faithful to me\nI remember, I remember\nEven when my own eyes could not see\nYou were there, always there\n\n[Verse 2]\nI will lift my eyes even in the pain\nAbove all the lies, I know You can make a way\nI have seen giants fall, I have seen mountains move\nI have seen waters part, because of You\n\n[Chorus]\nI remember\nI remember\nYou have always been faithful to me\nI remember\nI remember\nEven when my own eyes could not see\nYou were there, always there\nSee Lauren Daigle LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also like[Bridge]\nI can't stop thinking about\nI can't stop thinking about\nI can't stop thinking about\nYour goodness\n\nI can't stop thinking about\nI can't stop thinking about\nI can't stop thinking about\nYour goodness\n\nI can't stop thinking about\nI can't stop thinking about\nI can't stop thinking about\nYour goodness\n\nI can't stop thinking about\nI can't stop thinking about\nI can't stop thinking about\nYour goodness\n\n[Chorus]\nI remember\nI remember\nYou have always been faithful to me\nI remember\nI remember\nEven when my own eyes could not see\nYou were there, always there with meEmbed"
